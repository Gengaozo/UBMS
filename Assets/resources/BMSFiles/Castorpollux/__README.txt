Lyrics

"Imagined world"
They said there is no glowing lights

Gone faraway,
Fallin' raindrops whispered in my tears

Standing in the dark,
Wandering along the skies
And there were just frozen hearts like tears of snow

Say your wish to (the) stars,
A little voice from the clouds
See my shining pure hearts just been waiting for you

One day bright morning, I saw a glowing light
And there were your face, shining like a star

Come to me, kiss me, hold my hands for me,
Be my onlyone
In my heart, we can never wonder
(And) the starlights will be with us forever

Just in my dream
